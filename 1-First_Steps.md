# First Steps

> 'Hypertext' is a recent coinage. 'Hyper-' is used in the mathematical sense of extension and generality (as in 'hyperspace,' 'hypercube') rather than the medical sense of 'excessive' ('hyperactivity'). There is no implication about size— a hypertext could contain only 500 words or so. 'Hyper-' refers to structure and not size.

There are many routes to the joy of coding. We’re going to be focusing on JavaScript, the _lingua franca_ of the Web that allows one to create interactive content online and dynamic scripts via Node.js offline.

Beyond JavaScript, when one wishes to write programs that manipulate information in some way on a local machine or a remote server, there are many other options: Python, Ruby, C++, C Sharp, Java (which is not directly related to JavaScript—just a bad name), and Node.js. Here at TIME we typically use Node.js because it runs on the same engine as JavaScript, meaning the syntax is identical. It’s a rapidly developing language that is becoming very powerful.

Last, there are statistical coding languages like R, or the proprietary counterparts one encounters in academia like SPSS and STATA.

The key is to figure out which one you find the most fun and go from there!

For books on JavaScript, most people start with [_JavaScript: The Good Parts)_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do), by Doug Crockford.

My book, on the [JavaScript library RaphaelJS](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029601.do), is dated in the sense that it’s not a widely used library anymore, but I tried to write it as a fun way to learn programming in a visual way. If you buy a copy, please let me know and I will reimburse you the pittance I earn.

The publisher O’Reilly is reliable and has a book on almost any nook or cranny of any language.

If you want to know more about how computers work—which is not necessary—I highly recommend Dan Hillis’ [_The Pattern on the Stone_](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Stone-Computers-Science-Masters/dp/046502596X). A more in-depth treatment can be found in George Dyson’s [Turing’s Cathedral](https://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1529080653&sr=1-1&keywords=turing%27s+cathedral).
